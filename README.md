# ClinicalBERT-QF
This repo is a set of experiments investigating how query-free attacks can compromise LLMs trained to perform de-identification of sensitive healthcare information. This project illustrates how query-free attacks that have been implemented by Zhuang et al (https://github.com/OPTML-Group/QF-Attack/) on Text-To-Image Models like StableDiffusion can also be used against masked language models like ClinicalBERT.
